# NeQuick
The methodology of verification of the ionospheric model NeQuick 2 on the data of satellite measurements Swarm for 2014 is presented below. The model calculation, determination of statistics of the obtained errors, construction of maps reflecting the spatial distributions of mean errors, construction of curves of mean monthly errors for different geomagnetic conditions and latitudinal zones are implemented. During processing, the problem of dividing the time periods into days of geomagnetic storm and calm days is solved. This is done using the Kp and AE indices. 

The first script (raw_process.py) is used for direct calculation of the model and files recording, which will be analysed in the second script (map.ipynb).
